Home of the **official lively app** source code and issue tracker.

## Overview
### What is lively?
Have you ever said to yourself “I wish I could store and see all my information in one app instead of having to use a bunch of other apps”?

With *lively*, it does exactly that. With one app you can store all of your information from things like your fitness tracker to your budget, and you can view it all in the same app without having to download a bunch of apps to see all your stuff.


## Features
The app is in the very early stages of development so there aren’t any features to tell you about yet.

## Planned Features
- Budget Tracking
- Apple HealthKit Integration
- Calendar Integration
- Todo lists

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Features and Issues

##### Will you add [xyz] feature?

Open a [feature request][feature_request] and follow the instructions in the template if you want
to suggest a new feature.

##### Something in the app is broken

Open a [bug_report] and follow the instructions in the template to report bugs, crashes, and other
unexpected behaviours.

###### What not to do/say
- **"I reported this bug a week ago where is the fix?", "I asked for this feature
a while ago, why isn't it available yet?", or "Why won't you add the thing I asked
for"**
Developers have **zero obligation** to fulfill your requests and demands. You're more than welcome to make the requests,
but if you expect (and then complain when you don't receive) the things you want, like new features and bug fixes,
etc..., know that you're acting unbelievably entitled and ignoring the fact that developers:
1. Don't work for you,
2. Have *zero obligation* the serve you (especially when it comes to your behaviour in regards to the demand), and
3. Can do whatever they want, whenever they want.

Making demands and threatening developers if they don't fufill your each and every request while dealing with your
obvious lack of patience just paints you as an unpleasant person that thinks their each and every demand is more
important than anything in the world.

Additionally, acting like the developers unreasonably rejected your request no different than you claiming to have the
same amount of creative control over the app as the developers when you obviously don't.

- **[Insert generic threat here]**

Familiarize yourself with the [code of conduct][code_of_conduct]. Consider this your first and final notice about it.

- **"I want it this thing done now, you're not allowed to say no." or "The customer is always right**"
You couldn't possibly be any more wrong. Developers have **zero obligation** to fulfill any of your requests and can do
whatever they want, whenever they want.

Also the whole "the customer is always right" line couldn't be further from the truth. The developers are not paid nor do they have a contract with you, and you can't be a customer because *you didn't buy a single thing*.

- **"This app belongs to the community"**
No it doesn't. 

###### When will this app be released?
