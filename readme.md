## Overview

### What is lively?

Have you ever said to yourself “I wish I could store and see all my information in one app instead of having to use a bunch of other apps”?

With *lively*, it does exactly that. With one app you can store all of your information from things like your fitness tracker to your budget, and you can view it all in the same app without having to download a bunch of apps to see all your stuff.



## Features

The app is in the very early stages of development so there aren’t any features to tell you about yet.
